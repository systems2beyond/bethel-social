# Take Your Next Step.
We believe that everyone has something unique to offer. We offer a variety of ministries and programs designed to help you grow in your faith and explore new possibilities.

### Food Pantry
Our church is blessed to offer a free food pantry to support our community. If you or someone you know is in need, you're warmly invited to visit us every Wednesday and Saturday from 9:00 AM to 1:00 PM. No appointment is necessary — just come as you are. We're here to help with open hearts and open hands.

### All-Church Dinner
Our quarterly all-church dinner is happening later this month. RSVP using the form below and we look forward to seeing you there for a great evening!
